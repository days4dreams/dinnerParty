# dinnerParty
A C#-driven event estimator for Kathleen. Peforms calculations based on the clients needs of party size, menu choices and decorations. From HeadFirst C#; teaching of encapsulation (demos that the inputs only run once, NumberOfGuests should be private). 'Calculate' button would support use experience IMHO

Its no coincidence that the DinnerParty and BirthdayParty classes have a lot of the same code. Dinner parties and Birthday parties are both parties.
With two classes that are specific cases of something (party) they should inherit from the same class (a party base class).
